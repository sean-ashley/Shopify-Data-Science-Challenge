```
SELECT COUNT(OrderID) FROM Orders
JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID=Shippers.ShipperID
WHERE ShipperName='Speedy Express';
```

## b. What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?

Query:
The main idea of this query is joining Employees and Orders, grouping by last names and finding the last name that appears in the most orders.
```
SELECT LastName FROM Employees
JOIN Orders ON Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID
GROUP BY LastName
ORDER BY COUNT(LastName) DESC
LIMIT 1;

## c. What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?

I am assuming this means product with the highest total ordered quantity.

Query:
The main idea of this query is joining OrderDetails,Products,Orers, and Customers. We then filter to only get customers from Germany, and get the item with the highest total quantity ordered.
```
SELECT ProductName FROM Products
JOIN OrderDetails ON Products.ProductID=OrderDetails.ProductID
JOIN Orders ON OrderDetails.OrderID=Orders.OrderID
JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID
WHERE Customers.Country='Germany'
GROUP BY OrderDetails.ProductID
ORDER BY SUM(Quantity) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
